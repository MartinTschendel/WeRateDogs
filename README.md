# WeRateDogs
Wrangle and Analyze the data from the Twitter WeRateDogs

2019-03-10 In the Udacity Data Analytics Nanodegree, I'm working on a Data Wrangling Project with information from the twitter WeRateDogs. Hopefully I can upload the first ipynb tomorrow.

2019-03-11: I will upload an ipynb and html, what reflects the project status. More information will follow soon.

2019-03-12: Solved the following issues:
* Not every value of the column 'rating_denominator' has value 10
* each variable forms a column: rating_numerator and rating_denominator are actually one variable but separated in two columns (should be merged, ideally e.g. 8/10)
